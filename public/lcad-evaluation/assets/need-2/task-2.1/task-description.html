    <h1>Task 2 - Design optimization opportunity identification</h1>
    <div class="text-container">
    <p>
        The goal of Task 2 is to identify possible opportunities to make changes to the shaft design to reduce its environmental footprint.
        <br>
        <br>
        Assuming that you are only able to change the geometric features of the shaft, identify <b>feasible</b> opportunities to reduce the componentâ€™s overall environmental impact. 
        Note that the highest contributing geometric feature may not necessarily be feasibly changed, in which case, you may focus on the second, third, etc. most impactful feature.
