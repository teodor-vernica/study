# Introduction

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of three-dimensional (3D) visualizations for sustainable design.

You will be given a series of task corresponding to typical decisions a product designer has to make during the design process to intergrate sustainability metric (such as LCA results).

For each task, multiple data sources (e.g., LCA results, CAD models and drawings) will be given in order to comple the task including an interactive 3D visualization of the model where LCA results are mapped to the product geometry.

Use whatever data is necessary to complete the task.

Note that not ALL data is relevant/necessary for every task.

After each task, a short survey will ask how useful the 3D visualization was to achieve the task (if at all).
