# Introduction


## Study description

The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of three-dimensional (3D) feature-level Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) visualizations as a tool for sustainable product design decision-making.

In this study, you will be given three tasks based on typical designer needs when integrating LCA results into the design process. Throughout all three tasks, you will be working with a Screw Pump Shaft design as a case study. The goal is to understand the component’s environmental footprint, identify redesign opportunities to reduce its footprint, and compare it to a different product from the same product family.

All necessary data for making informed decisions will be available during each task. This includes LCA results (Global Warming Potential), CAD models and drawings, stress simulation results, and the 3D LCA visualization. You may use whatever data you want to complete the task, but note that **not all data may be necessary for every task**.

## Study instructions

+ Please complete the survey on a desktop computer or laptop in landscape mode, as it contains interactive 3D model applications which may not display properly on small screens (e.g., mobiles and tablets).
+ Please complete the survey in the **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** web browser to ensure proper functionality.
+ You can take as much time as you need to complete the survey, but please complete it in one sitting as progress may not be saved between sessions. The survey should take approximately 45 minutes.
<!-- + At the end of the survey, you will be prompted to download a file containing your answers. Please download the file and send it to us via email to either [teodor.vernica@mpe.au.dk](mailto:teodor.vernica@mpe.au.dk) or [devr@mpe.au.dk](mailto:devr@mpe.au.dk). You will be reminded of this at the end of the survey. -->

<!-- ## Visualization description

Similar to a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) visualization, the 3D LCA visualization maps the environmental impact of manufacturing a given design to the product geometry and its features. The visualization highlights regions of CO2 emission *concentration*, with values expressed in kg CO2 eq. / cm³.

![Allocation steps example](assets/data/Figures/shaft-stages-example.png)

Data is allocated sequentially, based on the processes modeled in LCA software to manufacture the product (as shown in the image above). With each step, the environmental impact of the process is mapped to the geometric features created or affected by the process. The final result highlights the **total** environmental cost of manufacturing specific geometric features. Note that intermediate processing steps will not be presented during this study, only the final results. -->
