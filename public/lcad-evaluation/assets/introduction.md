# Introduction


## Study description

The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of three-dimensional (3D) feature-level Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) visualizations as a tool for sustainable product design decision making.

In this study, you will be given three tasks that are based on typical designer needs when integrating LCA results into the design process.
Throught all three tasks, you will be working with a Shaft design as a case study.
The goal is to try to understand the component's environmental footprint, identify redesign opportunities to reduce its footprint, and compare it to a different product from the same product family.
During each task, all necessary data required to make an informed decision will be available. 
This includes, LCA results, CAD models and drawings, stress simulation results, in addition to the 3D LCA visualization.
You may use whatever data you want to complete the task, but note that not **all** data may be necessary for every task.

Each task will have a number of questions in the panel on the left.
Please answer all questions to the best of your knowledge before proceeding to the next question.
After each task, a short survey will ask how useful was the 3D LCA visualization for acomplishing the given task (if at all).

You will be given the opportunity to explore the visualization and study interface before starting the actual tasks. Take as much time as you need to familiarize yourself with the interface. The same data will be available during the actual tasks.

## Visualization description

Similar to a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) visualization, the 3D LCA visualization maps the environmental impact of manufacturing a given design to the product geometry and its features. The visualization highlights regions of CO2 emission *concentration*, and values are expressed in kg CO2 eq. / cm3.

Data is allocated sequentially, based on the processes modeled in LCA software to manufacture the product (as shown in the image above). With each step, the environmental impact of the process is mapped to the geometric features created or affected by the process. The final result highlights the **total** environmental cost of manufacturing specific geometric features. Note that itermediate processing steps will not be presented during this study, but only the final results.



## Study instructions

+ Please complete the survey on a desktop computer or laptop in landscape mode, as it contains iteractive 3D model applications which will not be properly displayed on small screens (e.g., mobiles and tablets).
+ Please complete the survey in the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge web browser to ensure the survey behaves as expected.
+ You can take as much time as you need to complete the survey, but please complete it in one sitting as progress may not be saved. The survey should take approximately [ADD TIME HERE].
+ At the end of the survey, you will be prompted to download a file containing your answers. Please downalod the file and send it to us via email to either [teodor.vernica@mpe.au.dk](mailto:teodor.vernica@mpe.au.dk) or [devr@mpe.au.dk](mailto:devr@mpe.au.dk). You will be remided of this at the end of the survey.
