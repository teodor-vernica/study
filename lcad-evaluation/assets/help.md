**Visualization description:** Similar to a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) visualization, the 3D LCA visualization maps the environmental impact of manufacturing a given design to the product geometry and its features. 
The visualization highlights regions of CO2 emission <em>concentration</em>, with values being expressed in kg CO₂ eq. / cm³.

![Allocation steps example](assets/data/Figures/shaft-stages-example.png)

Data is allocated sequentially, based on the processes modeled in LCA software to manufacture the product (as shown in the image above). 
With each step, the environmental impact of the process is mapped to the geometric features created or affected by the process.
Note that a process can affect multiple geometric features, and a feature may be affected by multiple processes.
If a new geometric feature is generated by removing material from a previous feature, the value previously assigned to the removed volume is transferred to the newly created feature.
Therefore, the final 3D LCA Visualization is a result of <b>all</b> processes and geometric transformations undergone by the Shaft, and it shows the <b>total</b> environmental cost of manufacturing specific geometric features expressed as kg CO₂ eq. / cm³.
