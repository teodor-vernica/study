        <strong>Instructions:</strong>
        
        <ol>
            <li><b>Watch the Video:</b> Start by watching the brief explanation video above. If you need to rewatch it later, you can find it by pressing the “Help” button in the top right of the study interface.</li>
            <li><b>Explore the Tabs:</b> Navigate through the tabs above to access various data about the Shaft Designs you will be working with throughout this study. Remember, the same data will be available during the actual tasks. Note that the data for Shaft Design B will only be available during the third (final) task, as it is not needed for the first two tasks.</li>
            <li><b>Task Relevance:</b> Keep in mind that not all data may be necessary for accomplishing a task.</li>
            <li><b>Ready to Start:</b> Once you are done familiarizing yourself with the study interface, type “ready” in the answer box in the left panel and click “Next” to move on to the first task.</li>
