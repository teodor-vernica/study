    <h1>Task 2 - Design optimization opportunity identification</h1>
    <p>Assuming that you are only able to change the geometric features of the shaft, identify feasible opportunities to reduce the componentâ€™s overall environmental impact. Note that the highest contributing geometric feature may not necessarily be feasibly changed, in which case, you may focus on the second, third, etc. most impactful feature.</p>
