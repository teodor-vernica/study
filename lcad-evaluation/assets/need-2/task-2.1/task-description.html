        <h1>Task 2 - Optimization Opportunity Identification</h1>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Identify feasible opportunities to modify Shaft Design A’s geometry to reduce its environmental footprint while maintaining its stress performance and functionality.</p>

        <p><strong>Instrunctions:</strong> Assuming that you are only able to change the product geometry, identify <b>feasible</b> opportunities to reduce the component’s overall environmental impact. 
        Note that the highest contributing geometric feature may not necessarily be feasibly changed without adversly affecting its stress performance or functionality. 
        In that case, you may focus on the second, third, etc. most impactful feature or a broader geometric change.
        Utilize the data provided in the tabs above to answer the questions on the left panel.
